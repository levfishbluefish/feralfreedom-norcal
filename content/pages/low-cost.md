## - Low Cost Spay-and-Neuter

**Adult Cats & Kittens**

FFNC works with a number of veterinarians and practices to connect pets and community cats to affordable, low-cost veterinary care. Because of this, prices for spays and neuters will range from **FREE to ~$150** depending on current availability, your location, and how soon you need the appointment. We will work with you directly to find the best solution for you and your pet.

Kittens must be at least **2lbs** and have had at least one **FVRCP vaccination at least 2 WEEKS prior to surgery**. Please email help@ffnc.live to schedule an appointment and let us know if you need assistance with vaccination appointments.
