# Low Cost Spay-and-Neuter

FFNC provides transport assistance for owned and community cats and kittens to low cost spay-and-neuter clinics. We currently work with vets in Redwood City and Turlock.


## Los Banos

**Adopted Cats** from the Los Banos Animal Shelter are eligible for $50 neuters and $60 spays, along with free first FVCRP vaccines, 1 year Rabies vaccines, and free microchips. 

If you have adopted a pet from the shelter please email help@ffnc.live with the animal's ID number and we will reach out to schedule your appointment.

**TNR** is currently free for all community cats in Los Banos. Cats will be picked up, spayed/neutered, and returned to your neighborhood. All cats will receive an ear-tip, vaccines, flea medication, and any other medical needs will be address at this time (wounds, ear cleanings etc). Microchips will be registered to Feral Freedom unless specifically requested otherwise. 

*This program runs on donations, if you are able please consider [donating](/pages/donate) so we can keep the program going!*
