Feral Freedom Northern California (FFNC)  is a non-profit, 501c3, dedicated to lowering shelter euthanasia rates for feral, stray, and community cats and kittens in Northern California. We work with shelters to create TNVR (Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return) programs by implementing the “Feral Freedom” program first introduced by Rick DuCharme at First Coast No More Homeless Pets in Jacksonville, Florida in 2008.

Variants of the program were started in the California Bay Area over ten years ago and are currently running self-sufficiently at the Humane Society of Silicon Valley, the San Jose Animal Care Center, and the Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority. The Feral Freedom Program at these shelters TNR’ed over 1700 cats in 2021. 

Rather than continually “recreating the wheel” at each shelter, FFNC provides shelters with a predesigned, proven program and works directly with shelter staff to implement the program, find and train volunteers, secure funding and veterinary resources, and provide community education.
